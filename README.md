# GraphQL Authentication with JWT

Example project to implement an OAuth 2.0 (Google) with Passport & GraphQL with Apollo V2 and Express over json web tokens.

**Version 2** now with:

* Graphql refactored schemas
* Apollo V2
* Babel 7
* Jest (instead of Mocha)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Node v10.4.1 or above
* Mongo database
* Google+ API Setup

### Installing

Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/antoniojps/graphql-authentication.git
```

Install dependencies

```
cd graphql-authentication
npm i
```

Setup the config in /src/setup/config/config.example.json:
* Rename the file to 'config.json'
* Add your variables

```
/src/setup/config/config.json
```

Run in the development environment

```
npm run dev
```

To test if the authentication is working open any of the following routes:
* Google - /auth/google

They should redirect you to the callback with the user data and token; A cookie is now set with the token

## Running the tests

If the above is done correctly running the tests should be as simple as:

```
npm run test
```

Make sure to the test variables in the config file /src/setup/config/config.json are setup correctly

### Running coding style tests

To clean up the code with eslint run

```
npm run eslint
```

## Deployment

Make sure you setup the production variables in the platform of your choise, the config.json file only defines variables for the 'development' and 'test' environments.

You need to change the callback routes to redirect to your client in /setup/routes/auth.js

```
// Replace this
// res.send(resSchema(req.user, res.statusCode))

// With
res.redirect(process.env.CLIENT_ORIGIN)
```

Build the project with
```
npm run build
```

Start the production server
```
npm start
```

## Built With
